# Design Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Headlines Too Big
**Problem**: Headlines throughout the app were extremely large, especially in the hero section (text-8xl), making them overwhelming and hard to read.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Global Typography**: Updated `src/app/globals.css` to use more reasonable headline sizes:
  - `h1`: `text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl` (was `text-4xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl`)
  - `h2`: `text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl` (was `text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl`)
  - `h3`: `text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl` (was `text-2xl md:text-3xl`)
  - Added `h4`, `h5`, `h6` with appropriate sizing

- **Hero Section**: Reduced hero headline from `text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl` to `text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl`
- **Other Sections**: Updated all large headlines throughout the main page to use more reasonable sizes
- **Tailwind Config**: Added custom font sizes (`hero-sm`, `hero-md`, `hero-lg`, `section-sm`, `section-md`, `section-lg`) for better typography control

### 2. Logo Visibility Issue
**Problem**: The BASA logo has white elements that were getting lost against the white/transparent header background.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Header Background**: Changed the default header background from `bg-white/80` to `bg-gray-900/90` for better contrast
- **Dynamic Styling**: Implemented conditional styling based on scroll state:
  - **Scrolled**: White background with dark text (original behavior)
  - **Not Scrolled**: Dark background with light text for better logo visibility
- **Navigation Links**: Updated text colors to be context-aware (dark text on white background, light text on dark background)
- **Buttons**: Applied conditional styling to all header buttons for proper contrast

### 3. Typography Hierarchy
**Problem**: Poor typography hierarchy with inconsistent sizing and line heights.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Improved Line Heights**: Updated line heights for better readability:
  - `h1`: `line-height: 1.2` (was `1.1`)
  - `h2`: `line-height: 1.3` (was `1.2`)
  - `h3`: `line-height: 1.4` (was `1.3`)
- **Consistent Sizing**: Created a more logical progression from h1 to h6
- **Better Spacing**: Improved margins and padding for better visual hierarchy
