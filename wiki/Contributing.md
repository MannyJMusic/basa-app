## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- **Follow Existing Patterns** - Match the existing code style
- **Use TypeScript** - All new code should be in TypeScript
- **Add Comments** - Comment complex logic and business rules
- **Keep Functions Small** - Aim for single responsibility
- **Use Meaningful Names** - Variables, functions, and components

### React/Next.js Guidelines

```typescript
// Component naming
const UserProfile = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  // Component logic
};

// Hook naming
const useUserData = (userId: string) => {
  // Hook logic
};

// File naming
// user-profile.tsx (kebab-case for files)
// UserProfile.tsx (PascalCase for components)
```

### Database Guidelines

```typescript
// Prisma model naming
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  email     String   @unique
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

// Migration naming
// YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

```typescript
// Test file naming
// component.test.tsx or component.spec.tsx

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```typescript
// API route testing
import { createMocks } from 'node-mocks-http';
import handler from '../pages/api/users';

describe('/api/users', () => {
  it('returns users list', async () => {
    const { req, res } = createMocks({
      method: 'GET',
    });

    await handler(req, res);

    expect(res._getStatusCode()).toBe(200);
    expect(JSON.parse(res._getData())).toEqual(
      expect.arrayContaining([
        expect.objectContaining({
          id: expect.any(String),
          email: expect.any(String),
        }),
      ])
    );
  });
});
```

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total price including tax
 * @param subtotal - The subtotal amount
 * @param taxRate - The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)

 */
const calculateTotal = (subtotal: number, taxRate: number): number => {
  return subtotal * (1 + taxRate);
